For this course, I recreated a photo in 3D using OpenGL and C++. Since this course was heavily focused on computer graphics, it has demonstrated the importance of creating software with aesthetically pleasing graphics or a UI.

When designing and developing the scene, I decided to start with the simplest shapes and features and work my way up to the more complicated ones. For example, when recreating a 3D object, I broke it down into primitive shapes and reconstructed it one shape at a time. This approach of breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable chunks could also be used in future projects.

This course has given me a better understanding of how computer graphics work in modern software. It has also helped me understand the importance of good design, which can help me if I work with UI/UX in the future. Having a good layout is crucial to developing aesthetically pleasing and functional software.

If I ever enter a career where computer graphics are essential for software to function properly, such as game development, I will feel more prepared to work on those projects than before I took this course.
